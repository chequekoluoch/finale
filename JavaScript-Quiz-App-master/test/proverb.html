        <p>"A bad workman always blames his tools.
        This proverb is used when someone blames the quality of their equipment or other external factors when they perform a
        task poorly."
        </p>
        <h5 class="author">Example: X: The turkey isn’t cooked well because the oven is not functioning well. Y: Well, it’s the case of a bad
        workman blaming his tools.</h5>

        Things we already have are more valuable than what we hope to get.
”</p>
        <h5 class="author">Example: X: Why did you turn down that job offer when you don’t have anything concrete in hand at the moment? Y: Well,
        I’m confident I’ll land one of the two jobs I interviewed for last week. And they’re better than this one. X: In my
        opinion, you should’ve taken it. A bird in hand is worth two in the bush.</h5>

        Actions are a better reflection of one’s character because it’s easy to say things, but difficult to act on them and
        follow through.
”</p>
